# Overview

The BasicSocialMedia project is a simplified social media platform implemented in Java. This software allows users to create profiles, post updates (both text and image posts), and follow other users. The platform then enables users to view posts from those they follow, effectively creating a basic social feed.

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate the usage of various Java features such as classes, data structures, and basic input/output handling. The project showcases how to build a small but functional social media application with the ability to save and load user data.
